# Favorite Labs
* Lab 1: 
  I liked this lab because it was a memorable experience for both me and my lab partner.
  We had never coded with Github before and were navigating our way through the software
  with many ups and downs. We learned a lot from this first lab and realized how important
  it was to read the instructions first.

* Lab 4:
  This was one of my favorite labs because I liked my lab partner and started to understand
  the material better than before. It was a helpful lab as I learned how the units_functions.cc
  code in turn helps the units.cc.

* Lab 8:
  While this was a bit of a difficult lab, I enjoyed it as I got to work with two lab
  partners, both of whom were very helpful and good and explaining parts of the lab I did
  not understand. We all collaborated and worked through how the vectors worked.
